- **Advanced Client Generation**: Generate unique clients with realistic contact data and billing information  
- **Product Groups & Attributes**: Organized product categories with CPU, Memory, Storage, Network, Security, and Backup attributes
- **Pricing System**: Multi-period pricing (monthly, quarterly, annually) with setup fees and options pricing
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic translations for all generated content
- **Unique Data Generation**: Ensures no duplicate emails, company names, or tax IDs
- **Performance Optimized**: Batch processing for large datasets with chunk-based creation

### üöÄ New Commands

#### Primary Command: `puqcloud:demo_seed`

Enhanced command with flexible options for generating different types of demo data:

```bash
